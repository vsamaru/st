Flareact is an **edge-rendered React framework** powered by Cloudflare Workers.

[![Deploy to Cloudflare Workers](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/flareact/flareact-template)

It's inspired by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

That means it supports nice API patterns like:

- File-based routing
- Dynamic page paths
- Data fetching for page props using `getEdgeProps`
- API routes
- Universal application rendering (worker and client)

However, it's brand new! So it's also a bunch of these things:

- **It probably does not work on Windows**
- Missing years worth of optimizations the Next.js team has implemented
